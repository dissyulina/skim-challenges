## Design and Features
![The webpage](static/readme/webpage.png)
- Color scheme was adopted from [SKIM website](https://skimgroup.com/).  
- The web page is fully responsive on all device sizes. On desktop, the challenges are positioned next to each other, while on mobile and tablets, the challenges are stacked vertically.   
- Input box is displayed with a placeholder to inform the user what input it expects. When the user inputs the wrong number, an error message appears to advise the user to input the correct one.  
- Besides calculate/ run button, a reset button is also added in order to reset the input and result back to the beginning. The colors change subtly when the mouse hovers above both buttons.  
- Both challenges are horizontally and vertically centered on the desktop.
